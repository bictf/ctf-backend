Dear Diary,
Today I learned about colors, what a strange concept.
It turns out that everyone can see them, everyone but me :(
I wish we lived in a world where everyone could enjoy all the colors of the rainbow but unfortunately I was cursed with severe color blindness!!! I can't tell the difference between blue and other blues or as others call them yellow.
My condition is called "bummer" or by its scientific name "tritanopia", I hope some (not Israeli) scientist will invent a cure for this horrible disease.
But a terrorist can only dream.
