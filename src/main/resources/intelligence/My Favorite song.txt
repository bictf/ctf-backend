My (I am muhammad, in case the users of this system (aka me) forgot) favorite song is probably "I Want It That Way" by The Backstreet Boys!

I especially like the Jihad's tisa tisa very funny clip on it.
Very funny when they try to find the dirty Zionist by his singing ability! I almost cried XDXD

P.S. I am very lonely, if anyone else is reading this please be my friend.
