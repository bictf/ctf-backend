I am muhammad, the very akbar data jihadist in this team, and I will explain how our encryption works to myself because I forget every other day:

We encrypt our data using xor encryption.
We care about security very much, and because of that we put a lot of money (around the amount 100 IDF soliders get in a hour) on crypto research.
We discovered that 128 bit encryption is very good, but we are a bit paranoid so we chose to do 2^128 + 1337 encryption.

As such, we do (very_secret_data)xor(2^128 + 1337).
Lets see those zionists break this XDXDXD

P.S. I keep forgetting the xor password, its the 16th word in the chorus of the only song I would want to hear!
